        that turns up on the ROAD, and a car that turns up PARKED AND UNPLUGGED after the cloud
        went quiet. Both mean the same thing — the charge is over and the live frame is not its
        end — and both were closing on nothing before their respective fixes (#208, and the 30/08
        audit for the parked one).

        The live frame is no longer the end of the charge. @mikeeeeekoo's car finished at 100 %
        and read 98.1 % by the time Mate saw it: ten kilometres of road, not two points that never
        went in. So the end comes from the last reading taken WHILE CHARGING, dated by the car's
        own clock.

        ONE EXCEPTION, and it is a measurement rather than a guess: a car whose odometer has not
        moved cannot have spent anything, so if it reappears HIGHER than that last reading it kept
        charging while we were blind — Silvio's "lost at 80 %, seen at 95 %". When it HAS moved,
        the peak is unknowable (100 % then driven, or stopped at 97 %, look identical from here)
