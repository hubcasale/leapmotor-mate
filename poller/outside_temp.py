"""Live outside-air temperature for the car's current spot, from Open-Meteo.

The Leapmotor cloud carries no ambient-temperature signal (poller/client.py: outside_temp is always
None — the one candidate, 2101, is seat ventilation), which is why it's missing from the official app
too. Open-Meteo gives the weather for a lat/lon, keyless and free (~10 000 requests/day PER IP, i.e.
per install). Opt-in, because the position leaves the device.

Cached hard: weather moves by the hour and a parked car doesn't move at all, so a fresh lookup only
happens when the last one is STALE (older than _MAX_AGE_S) or the car has MOVED more than
_MAX_MOVE_KM, and a failed one is not asked again before _RETRY_S. A day of driving is then a few
dozen calls, nowhere near the cap; a parked car makes none. The live samples are stored on each
position, so they also become the trip's temperature (averaged along the real route) —
elevation_enrich.fetch_trip_temperature stays as the fallback for trips with no live sample.
