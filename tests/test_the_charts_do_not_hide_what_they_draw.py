"""Two charts, measured in a real browser — is what they draw actually visible?

Both defects arrived the same day, from two different owners, and neither is about a wrong number:
the figures were right and the pixels were not.

  #268 (@pdifeo) — Battery health, "Estimated capacity per charge": ApexCharts pins a y-annotation
  label to the RIGHT edge of the plot, which is exactly where the newest charges sit. The
  "Nominal 28.4 kWh" box sat on top of the last four dots — the ones you open the chart to read.

  #269 (@adoewa) — Charges, the AC/DC ring: ApexCharts styles the ring's *label* and the percentage
  on the segment, but leaves the number in the middle on its own default fill, a near-black that
  disappears on our dark card. His screenshot has everything legible except the count.

So neither is checked by looking at the HTML: what the templates emit was correct in both cases.
These two tests read the drawing itself — the label's box against the dots' boxes, and the fill the
browser actually resolved — which is the only place the defect exists.

Costs, and the limit, of every browser test here: fastapi + uvicorn + pytest-playwright + a
Chromium, none of them in CI's minimal env, so this file SKIPS there and guards this laptop.

    """Eight AC charges, each with the telemetry battery health integrates.

    `get_battery_health` does not read `energy_added_kwh`: it integrates |V·I|dt over the logged
    samples and divides by the SoC that rose across them, so a charge with no `positions` rows is
    skipped entirely and the chart comes back empty. Hence 30 samples per charge, five minutes
    apart, at 350 V · 33.4 A ≈ 11.7 kW — 28.25 kWh over 40 SoC points, an estimate of 70.6 kWh
    against a 69.9 nominal.

    That 0.7 kWh is the whole point, and the first version of this seed got it backwards. At 32 A
    the estimate came out at 67.7 — BELOW the line — and the dots sat under an annotation label
    that hangs above it, so the test passed on the released template and proved nothing. @pdifeo's
    car reads 29 against a 28.4 nominal: the dots are just ABOVE the line, which is where the label
    is, and that is the only arrangement in which the defect exists.

    20 → 60 % and never near the top: above 95 % (`_SOH_TOP_CUTOFF_SOC`) the integration stops, and
    below 15 % the point is excluded as a near-empty start. `charge_type` is written 'AC'
    explicitly — left to the power heuristic, 11.7 kW is over the 11 kW AC ceiling and would
    have turned every one of these into a DC session.
