"""Two Mate installs, one MQTT broker (@ebagnoli, BetaTester #13).

He had MQTT on both the official add-on and the BetaTester one, same parameters, and reported that
the beta *"non ha mai visto la luce"*. It had. The discovery device id is built from the topic prefix
and the VIN, so two installs on the same prefix watching the same car are **indistinguishable** to
Home Assistant: one device, and the second one just rewrites the first one's configs over
themselves. Nothing to see, and nothing that says why.

The part nobody noticed is worse than the invisible one: both subscribe to `<prefix>/+/command`, and
the handler passed the topic's VIN straight to the cloud API. One button press in Home Assistant was
executed **twice**, by two different Leapmotor accounts, on the same car — and since both installs
publish near-identical states, the duplication left no trace on screen.

Three things had to be true for the fix to work at all, and the first one was a defect of its own:
the bridge never re-read its settings, so changing the prefix did nothing while the page answered
"Saved — restart not needed". That was told to a tester as advice before it was checked.
