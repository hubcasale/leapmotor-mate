"""#272 @kingean93 — the owner types the solar kWh of a charge, Mate bills only the rest.

He has solar, a mapped wallbox, and no Home Assistant helper: `custom_kwh` (beta #13) reads the
BOUGHT kWh off an HA entity, and he has no entity to read. So he types the number instead — and
types the one he can read straight off an inverter, which is what the sun gave, not what he bought.

The two directions matter, because they are the mistake this field is shaped around: a charge of
20.0 kWh with 8.0 from the roof costs 12.0 x the home price. Type 12.0 into a field labelled Solar
and the same charge costs 8.0 x the price — cheaper, plausible, and wrong in silence. Hence a
refusal above the measured energy, and a line on the card that spells the whole subtraction out.

CI-safe: db_reader + template text, no fastapi.
