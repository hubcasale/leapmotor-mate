"""The €/kWh on a charge card names the kilowatt-hours underneath it.

@Tommy73LMB05, #346: an HPC session read **17,45 €**, **+41,2 kWh In der Batterie (DC)**,
**0,37 €/kWh** — and the Overview's *Ø-Preis in der Batterie* read **0,405**. Both figures are
right. 17,45 / 47,28 (what the column delivered, typed in) = 0,369; 17,45 / 41,2 (what reached the
pack) = 0,424, blended down to 0,405 because he plugged in at 16,6 %. Two correct numbers, one
money, two denominators — and the screen called both of them €/kWh.

The split is deliberate (`_billed_kwh` divides by what billed you, `_wac_blend` by what a trip
actually consumes). What was missing is the word saying which is which: the rate sat under
"+41,2 kWh In der Batterie" while dividing by 47,28, and there was no way to tell from the screen.

🔑 The basis is not a constant — it is `_billed_kwh`'s own branch (wallbox counter → the charger's
figure typed in → the battery kWh), so the label has to be read from the same place the number is,
or the two drift apart on the next change.
