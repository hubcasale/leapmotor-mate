"""The pieces of a group confirmed BEFORE the fix have to be repaired, or the fix reaches nobody.

`update_charge_type` now prices every piece — but only when someone confirms a charge, and a charge
already confirmed is never touched again. Measured on a container: the corrected code, opened on a
database written by the old one, still shows 2,00 € for a 15 kWh home charge. The fix would ship and
change nothing for the people who already have the defect, which is the shape that bit us in August
with the responsiveness badge.

The repair takes the rate the group was PRICED AT — the parent's own cost ÷ its own billed energy —
rather than today's tariff. A confirmed cost is frozen ('new charges only'), so re-pricing the
parent with the prices in effect now would rewrite history to fix an omission. The parent is never
written at all: only the children get the type and the missing share, at the rate their group
already carries.

Groups whose price belongs to the GROUP and already sits on the parent — a MANUAL total, a typed
gross_kwh (#222) — get the type on their children and no cost, exactly as a fresh confirm would.
