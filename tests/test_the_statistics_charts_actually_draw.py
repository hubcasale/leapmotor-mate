"""The Statistics charts, opened in a real browser — do they actually DRAW?

Beta #38 (@michapr): the "Consumption vs outside temperature" card came out blank. Not empty of
data — the caption under it printed the fitted trend, which the server computes only from eight
points or more — but blank on screen, with nothing in the console. The card had been added above
the line where the page loads `chart.umd.min.js`, so its inline script ran while `Chart` did not
exist yet and its own `typeof Chart === 'undefined'` guard returned in silence.

Every existing check on this page reads the rendered HTML, and the HTML was correct: the canvas, the
data and the script were all in it. What was wrong was the ORDER the browser executes them in, which
no assertion on a string can see. Its sibling, test_charts_load_their_library_first.py, pins that
order cheaply and runs everywhere; this one is the expensive proof that the pixels arrive.

Same costs, and the same limit, as test_the_overview_runs_in_a_browser_without_a_javascript_error.py:
fastapi + uvicorn + pytest-playwright + a Chromium, none of them in CI's minimal env, so this SKIPS
there and guards the laptop it runs on.

    Twelve and not five: get_efficiency_vs_temp fits its trend line only from eight points up, and
    the trend is what proved, in @michapr's screenshot, that the server side was already fine. A
    seed below that threshold would draw the dots and still leave this test unable to tell the two
    halves of the card apart.

    Each trip needs all three of: `distance_km` >= 3 (shorter ones are held out on purpose —
    preconditioning spread over three kilometres reads as a cold penalty that isn't one), a
    non-NULL `efficiency_kwh_100km` (NULL is how finalize_trip marks a generator trip, which
    belongs to the petrol series), and at least one outside temperature. The temperatures are
    spread from -3 °C to 30 °C so the fit has something to fit.
