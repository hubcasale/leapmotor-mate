"""A frame the cloud is only RE-SERVING must not count as energy the car drew.

THE BUG. While charging at a mapped wallbox the recorder sends `accumulate_wallbox_energy`
what the CAR says it took over this poll (`charge_power_kw × poll_interval`). That figure
exists for one purpose (#215): to tell a STOPPED meter from a slow one — while the counter
does not move, the car-reported energy piles up in `wb_stuck_kwh`, and past 3.0 kWh
`finalize_charge` decides the meter is dead and throws the whole measured AC total away,
billing the charge on the battery instead.

But an unreachable car does not make the cloud say so: it re-serves the LAST frame,
identical payload, identical timestamp, poll after poll — the same lie `stale` already
guards against for saved positions and for regen, twenty lines above. That frozen frame
still reads "7 kW", so a car that stopped charging (or fell off the network entirely) keeps
"drawing" 7 kW on paper while the wallbox counter, correctly, stands still.

MEASURED: 7 kW at the default 30 s parked cadence is 0.0583 kWh per poll, so 52 repeats —
about 26 minutes of frozen frame — cross the 3.0 kWh threshold and the charge loses its
measured wallbox energy. Frozen frames of three and a half hours are already documented in
this codebase (`charge_end_from_last_charging`).

THE FIX: the car-reported figure is gated on `not stale`, exactly like the regen two lines
above it. The wallbox reading itself is NOT gated — it comes from Home Assistant, not from
the Leapmotor cloud, so it is fresh whatever the car's link is doing.

CI-safe: recorder + poller db only, no fastapi.
