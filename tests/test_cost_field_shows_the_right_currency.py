"""The cost box has to be labelled in the reader's OWN money.

Found by looking at the running app while testing #237, on the very form that was being extended.
Two separate slips, three copies, and neither has ever been caught by a test:

  · the "add a past charge" form printed `{{ currency }}` — the whole metadata DICT — so the
    placeholder read `{'name': 'Euro', 'symbol': '€', 'pos': 'after', 'dec': 2}`, clipped by the
    input to `{'name': 'I`. Since v1.30.0 (#87), which is when that form was written.
  · the two type-and-price boxes hard-coded `€`, which is right for one of the fourteen
    currencies Mate offers and wrong for the other thirteen — a reader in £ or zł is told to type
    euros into a field that will be totalled in their own money.

Rendered, not grepped: a source-level assertion here would pass on a template that renders
`{'name': 'Euro'…}` perfectly happily, and this defect is only visible once something is drawn.

    `charge_card.html` and `charge_type_badge.html` are rendered STANDALONE by the search endpoint
    and by the two type/free toggles, from contexts they build by hand — they inherit nothing from
    `_ctx`. Naming `currency.symbol` in a partial that is handed no `currency` is an UndefinedError
    at render time, which is a 500 on a page that used to work.

    So the check is not "the three I found": it is every TemplateResponse in main.py naming a
    template that reaches one of them, forever. → [[feedback-gate-a-feature-find-every-copy]]

    The Charges calendar renders the day drawer INLINE when the request carries `open_day`
    (base.html adds it by itself from the remembered day), so the chain is

        charges_calendar_month.html → charges_calendar_day_content.html → charge_card.html

    · **two levels of include, not one.** The old closure followed exactly one, and its own
      comment claimed that was "as deep as this tree goes". It wasn't.
    · **the context was a variable.** `_render_charges_calendar` builds `ctx = {...}` and passes
      the NAME, so a regex looking for a dict literal inside the call never saw it.

    Hence: closure to a fixed point, and the context read with `ast` — dict literal, `_ctx(...)`
    call, or a local name assembled above (including `ctx["k"] = …` and `.update({...})`).
    A shape this cannot read is a FAILURE, not a pass: silence is how the last one got through.
