"""The kilometres the generator drove are a figure, not a footnote — @gm27271, beta #31.

He asked for a layout. He got three answers about measurement, all of them correct and none of them
about what he asked, and after two weeks he closed the thread with: *«OK, whatever. Then let's
display this distance in crappy comment after loads of text like today.»*

He was describing the page accurately. Measured in the browser on a generator trip:

    the note before the number   217 characters, 41 words
    the number's type            10px, rgb(100,116,139)
    the same treatment as        "v3.14.23", the build number in the sidebar corner

One `·` at the end of a paragraph, in the smallest type on the card, for the one figure a
range-extender owner opens this page to read. Nothing about the number changes here; only where it
sits.

🔑 **And promoting it means carrying its limit with it.** There is no "generator on" signal in the
cloud — all 89 signals were checked, and the best of them separates at 61% once the car is already
moving. The kilometres are counted from the samples where the odometer rises *and* the fuel falls,
and that count is SHORT: 54.0 against the 60.2 km @pdifeo's own dashboard showed. A number in 10px
grey claims nothing; the same number on its own line claims confidence, so the line has to say it
is a floor. Otherwise this trades a layout defect for the two-numbers-one-word defect.

What the figure LOOKS like once it is out of the note — its size and its colour — is decided
by inheritance and can only be read in a browser: that half is in
test_the_generator_distance_is_legible.py. This file holds the half that runs in CI.
