"""A trip abandoned by the cloud must end when the car last spoke — not half an hour later.

THE HALF THAT WAS LEFT. v3.10.6 stopped a trip from *absorbing* kilometres nobody watched. This is
the other end of the same silence: a trip left open on a frozen "gear D" frame is closed by the
30-minute guard (#233), and it was closed with the clock reading NOW. So the trip carried up to
half an hour in which, by definition, nothing was observed — inflating its duration and deflating
its average speed, on a car that had already been parked in the drive the whole time.

The odometer was never the problem: the frozen frame IS the last real measurement, so the distance
was already right. Only the TIME lied.

THE PATTERN ALREADY EXISTED, one table over. Since #208 a charge the car drove away from is closed
on the last reading taken WHILE CHARGING, dated with the car's own clock (`frame_ts`) rather than
with the poll that noticed — on @mikeeeeekoo's overnight charge, the difference between 06:10 and
09:36. Trips had no equivalent and closed with whatever frame was in hand.

⚠️ The car's clock is preferred but CHECKED, exactly as the charge does: a `frame_ts` from before
the trip opened (host skew, or a partial frame carrying someone else's timestamp) would invert the
session, so it is only taken when it falls inside the trip.

🔑 During a frozen stretch the recorder does not save positions at all while DRIVING (#128), so the
last `positions` row of an abandoned trip already IS the last thing the car said. Nothing new has to
be recorded to know this — it was on disk the whole time.

CI-safe: pure recorder / state-machine / db logic, no fastapi.
