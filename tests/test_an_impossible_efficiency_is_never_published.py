"""A charge can never put more into the battery than the wall gave it (#295 @gm27271).

His wallbox page showed one session at **7.69 kWh AC · 10.03 kWh DC · 130.4 %**, and painted the
130.4 % GREEN — the same colour it uses for an excellent charge, because the macro only asks
whether the number is ≥ 88. The charge card had known better since it was written: it computes the
same ratio and hides it above 100 %, with a comment saying why. Two screens, two policies, and the
one that spoke was the one that was wrong.

So the rule moves to where the arithmetic already lives — `wallbox_session_energy` and
`wallbox_ac_dc_totals`, the pair whose own docstring records what it cost to have this in two
places (#229). The two kWh figures stay on screen: they are what was measured, and a reader
comparing them is exactly how this got reported. Only the ratio, which claims the two are
comparable, is withheld.

⚠️ NOT a decision about which number to believe. Nothing stored is touched and no meter figure is
thrown away — `poller/db.py` is deliberate that a DC figure resting on a battery capacity the user
types in must never discredit a measured one. This is about what a page may assert.
