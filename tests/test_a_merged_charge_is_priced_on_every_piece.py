"""Confirming a merged charge must price ALL of it, not just the row you clicked.

Found by **@damde** (PR #258): `update_charge_type` writes the parent only, so the child pieces stay
untyped and unpriced — and the Charges page sums the pieces, counting nothing for them. A 15 kWh
home charge split 10 + 5 shows two thirds of its cost. Measured across every type: HOME with and
without a wallbox, AC, DC and HPC all lose exactly the share of energy sitting in the children; only
a hand-typed MANUAL total survives, because that number lives on the parent and nobody divides it.

The fix takes his finding and keeps ONE pricing rule — `update_charge_type` applied to each piece —
rather than a second implementation of it beside the first. Three shapes, in this order:

  * a MANUAL total is the GROUP's price → it stays on the parent, children carry no cost;
  * a typed `gross_kwh` (#222) is the GROUP's meter reading → same: it prices the whole group once,
    on the parent, children carry no cost. The typed number is NEVER rewritten or split;
  * otherwise every piece is priced on its own energy, exactly as an unmerged charge would be.

The last three tests are guards, not new behaviour: they hold what `unmerge_charges` promises —
*"Nothing was ever overwritten, so they come back exactly as they were"* — and the migration guard
`_charges_have_gross` exists for, an OperationalError that was a 500 on Silvio's own instance hours
after v3.6.6 shipped.
