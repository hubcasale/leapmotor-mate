"""The age of the DATA, next to the age of the row (#178 @riri19).

He described the failure exactly: the car drops out of cloud coverage, the cloud keeps answering
every poll with the last frame it received, and Mate's "Last seen" cheerfully says 13s while the
position and battery on screen are half an hour old. `frame_ts` is the car's own clock on that
frame, so the difference is finally visible.

What these tests really pin is the SILENCE, which two rules protect.

A parked car legitimately carries hours-old data, so the age is announced only when the last frame
had the car DRIVING or CHARGING. That's #130's lesson: we turned down a red/green cloud light
because a car asleep in a garage also stops reporting, and "a light that cries wolf every night
isn't an alert, it's noise".

And it must have fallen behind THE ROW, not merely be old. If Mate itself hasn't polled for forty
minutes then both ages read forty minutes — the same fact twice, under the same label, which is the
duplicate-number defect this project has been shown before. The demo container caught that one:
`9 min ago · data 9m old`.
