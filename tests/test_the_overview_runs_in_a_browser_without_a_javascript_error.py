"""The Overview, opened in a real browser — does its JavaScript actually run?

The suite has 312 files and not one of them opens a page. `TestClient` returns the HTML and every
existing check reads that string, which means a page can be served 200 OK, look complete to every
test we have, and still be dead in the hand: the Overview carries ~120 lines of inline script plus
Leaflet, and a single uncaught exception in there stops the command buttons, the 30 s refresh and
the map without changing one byte of the HTML we assert on.

This is the first test that runs the page instead of reading it. It asserts the one thing a string
comparison can never see — the browser raised no uncaught error — and nothing else. Deliberately
`pageerror` and not console errors: a console error is also what a blocked map tile logs, so it
would go red on a slow network rather than on a defect. An uncaught exception is never anything
but our bug.

Costs: fastapi + uvicorn + pytest-playwright + a Chromium. None of them are in CI's minimal env
(.github/workflows/ci.yml installs pytest, cryptography, jinja2, leapmotor-api, paho-mqtt), so
today this file SKIPS there and guards only the laptop it runs on — the same half-measure
test_access_card_markup.py's docstring warns about. Adding them to the CI step is what turns it
into a real guard; that is a separate, deliberate decision, not something this file assumes.

    A latitude and a longitude are not decoration here: the Overview's map, and the Leaflet code
    that draws it, is created only from a real position. Seed a car with no fix and this test would
    pass over a page that never ran the half we care about.

    `speed_kmh` is written explicitly, and 0.0 rather than left out, because leaving it out is a
    500: main._driving does `pos.get("speed_kmh", 0) > 1`, and a default only answers for a key
    that is ABSENT — a column that is there and NULL comes back as None, and None > 1 raises. A
    parked car (gear 'P') takes that branch every time. Silvio's own 276.672 rows have no NULL
    speed, so this is a trap rather than a live fault, but the seed must not walk into it: a
    fixture that 500s here would hand every later browser test an error page to pass over.
