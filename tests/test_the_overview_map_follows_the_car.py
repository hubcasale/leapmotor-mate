"""The Overview map follows the car.

It was drawn once, when the page loaded. The status card beside it refreshes itself every 30 s, so
the page said "last seen 6 s ago" over a marker left wherever the car was when the page was opened —
on a drive, kilometres behind it — until the page was reloaded.

The marker now comes from ONE builder, `main._last_position`: the page's first paint embeds it, and
the map polls it at /api/last-position. It reads what the poller already stored and tells the map
how often to ask — the poller's driving cadence, whatever the car is doing, because the web cannot
see the poller's real schedule. Nothing here reaches Leapmotor's servers.
