"""The generator's distance, measured where the defect actually lives: in the rendered page.

@gm27271, beta #31 — *«let's display this distance in crappy comment after loads of text like
today»*. Everything about that sentence is true of the HTML, and none of it can be read off the
HTML: the figure inherited its type from the paragraph it was glued to, so only the browser knows
what size it came out at. On the released build, on a generator trip:

    the paragraph before it   217 characters, 41 words
    the figure's own type     10px, rgb(100,116,139)
    the same type as          "v3.14.23", the build number in the sidebar corner

So this test seeds one trip shaped like his (176 km, the generator running for 25 of them), serves
the page, and asks the browser two questions: how big is that number, and what colour.

Cost, and the limit, of every browser test here: fastapi + uvicorn + pytest-playwright + a
Chromium, none of them in CI's minimal env, so this file SKIPS there and guards this laptop. The
source-level half — that the figure left the note, is printed once, and carries its floor — is in
test_the_generator_distance_has_a_line_of_its_own.py and runs everywhere.
