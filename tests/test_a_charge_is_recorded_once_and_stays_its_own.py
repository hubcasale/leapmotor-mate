"""Two ways one physical charge stops being one row in the database.

Both were found by the 30/08 audit, both were reproduced against the real Recorder and Database,
and neither made a single test fail — the suite was green with both of them in.

They share a cause: `process()` runs the state machine's events BEFORE the reconstruction pass, and
the reconstruction guard reads state that those events have just changed.

  1. DOUBLE. `_handle_event` finalizes a closing charge and clears `_active_charge_id`; twenty lines
     later `_maybe_reconstruct_charge` looks at that same poll, finds "parked, nothing open, SoC far
     above the baseline" and files the charge a SECOND time as reconstructed. The guard did not
     fail — it was answered after the answer had changed.

  2. FUSED. The close only happens on CHARGING -> parked or -> DRIVING. A charge that ends while the
     cloud is unreachable goes CHARGING -> OFFLINE -> PARKED_ACTIVE, which is neither, so the row
     dangles open — and the next plug-in "resumes" it, because re-entering CHARGING with a charge
     open is read as "we never unplugged". True normally; false after an outage.

CI-safe: recorder + poller db only, no fastapi.
