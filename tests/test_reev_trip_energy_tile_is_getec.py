"""On a range extender the trip's energy tile shows getEC — nothing derived from SoC (beta #11).

@michapr, 05/08/26: *"Since I've realized that the SoC difference shouldn't matter for calculating
travel costs — and given that we always use getEC — I don't think we need to display that value here
anymore. To avoid confusion, we should only show the getEC value that is actually used for the
calculation. In my case, that's 2.0 kWh (which is where the €0.50 in the image comes from)."*

Both branches the tile used to choose between are SoC arithmetic:

  * `battery_net_kwh` — ΔSoC × capacity, computed on read (db_reader.get_trip_detail);
  * `energy_kwh`      — efficiency × distance, where the efficiency itself was
                        `(start_soc − end_soc) / 100 × capacity / km` when the trip closed
                        (poller/db.py::finish_trip).

On a series hybrid the generator refills the pack mid-drive, so neither measures what the driving
used. And neither is what the money printed beside them is billed on: a range-extender trip is
priced by drawing the paid stock down by `ec_kwh` (reev_trip_electric_cost). One tile, one number,
and it is the one the cost agrees with.

Silvio's rule behind it, the same day: *«sulle REEV non possiamo basarci sul SoC perché varia e sale
e scende in base se parte o meno il generatore»*.

📍 18/09/2026 (beta D #31): the tile became the first line of the ⚡ box of the boxed trip summary,
on every car. The box names the energy, so the "Energy used" label went; which figure is printed —
getEC on a range extender and nothing derived from SoC — is exactly what the tests below hold.
