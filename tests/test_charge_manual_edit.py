"""#188 (@adoewa): a charge you TYPED IN can be corrected — times, SoC, energy, cost.

Two things had to be true before the form could exist. Mate has to know which rows were typed,
and `location_type='MANUAL'` cannot answer that: it doubles as the COST BASIS a user picks to
type the price of a real, measured session. Gating on it would have handed out the timestamps and
SoC the car reported, to be rewritten by a form. Hence `manual_entry`, and hence the second half
of these tests, which check what the edit REFUSES rather than what it changes.

The other half is the display: a typed-in charge carries no SoC, and the card used to draw the
missing value as a measured `0.0% → 0.0%` with a yellow `+0.0%` beside it.

Poller schema + db_reader on a tmp DB → CI-safe.
