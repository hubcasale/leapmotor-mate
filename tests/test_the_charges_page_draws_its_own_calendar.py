"""#240 — the Charges page must never be an empty box under a banner.

@Ng-EY: *"the charging page show the 1 charge(s) to confirm on top but not showing at bottom.
Have to put in a date to make it show up"*. Silvio reproduced it: press Refresh and the calendar
disappears for good on the test instance, and on production the months stop going back.

One cause underneath both. Clicking a day is REMEMBERED (sessionStorage), and from then on
base.html adds `open_day` to every calendar request for that month — so the response renders the
day drawer INLINE, which reaches `charge_card.html`, which prints `currency.symbol`. The
calendar's own context never carried a currency, so it was a 500. htmx swaps nothing on a 500,
which is why nothing appeared and nothing said why: the remembered day kept re-arming it on
every reload. On production the remembered day was in an OLDER month, so only paging back broke.

Three defences here, and each was seen red before it was written green:
  · the grid renders with a day open (the 500 itself);
  · the page carries the grid in its own HTML, so a failed request cannot empty it;
  · the banner is a link to the charge, which is what the reader was asking for all along.
