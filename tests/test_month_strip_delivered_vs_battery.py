"""The Ricariche month strip: the energy told as the pair it always was.

It printed one bare number — "154.93 kWh" — and that number was already a mixture: the wallbox
counter on the home charges that have one, the battery figure everywhere else. Neither word applied
to it, so none was written. Silvio asked for "all the month's gross kWh, the wallbox ones included",
and the honest answer was that the wallbox ones were in there all along; what was missing was the
label, the charger's own kWh (#222), and the other half of the story.

Measured on real data, July: 11 sessions, 10 with a wallbox counter → 129.95 kWh from the meter plus
24.98 from the battery on the one without = 154.93 delivered, against 142.57 that reached the
battery. The 12.36 kWh between them is what the on-board charger turned into heat.
