"""A charge that cost nothing must read 0,00 € — not the dash that means "no price known".

#218 settled it for the pricing engine: a zero is a price. The cost cell never got the message. It
tests the cost for truth — `{% if charge.cost %}` — and 0.0 is falsy in Jinja exactly as in Python,
so a genuinely free charge renders identical to one nobody has priced: grey, and a dash.

Three real ways to get here, and the third arrived today:
  · the #120 "free" tick on a home charge (solar, or any charge that cost nothing),
  · a time-of-use band priced at 0 the owner typed on purpose,
  · #272's solar figure equal to the measured energy — a charge entirely off the roof.

The distinction is `is none` versus falsy, and it has to be made in all three places on that line:
the colour, the figure, and the €/kWh under it.
