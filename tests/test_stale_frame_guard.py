"""Stale cloud frames while driving — issue #128 (Wartopia).

When the car cannot reach the cloud (4G dead zone, or the eSIM re-registering on a foreign network
after a border crossing), the cloud does not report "unknown": it keeps re-serving the LAST frame it
received — identical payload, identical `sts` timestamp — poll after poll. Wartopia's diagnostics
caught it twice in one evening, on both legs of a Nijmegen↔Germany run: ~5.5 minutes of frames frozen
at 52 and 72 km/h, while the odometer proved the car had actually driven 1 and 4 km meanwhile.

Recording those repeats invents data: a flat speed plateau in the chart, a route standing still, ~34
phantom GPS points per episode, and regen accrued from a frozen current.

The test is FRAME IDENTITY, deliberately not a frame-age threshold: the same logs show the host clock
running ~48s behind the cloud, so "age > N seconds" would be measuring the wrong thing. A repeated
timestamp means the same packet, whatever either clock says.

These pin the guard and, just as importantly, its limits: it must never fire while parked (a sleeping
car legitimately freezes for hours) and must never hide frames from the state machine.
