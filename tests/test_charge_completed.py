"""Signal 3736 (chargeCompleted) → a persisted `charge_completed` flag + the overview's
"Fully charged" badge.

The poller parses 3736 into VehicleData.charge_completed and writes it to the positions row;
the web reads it back via get_latest_status (SELECT *), and charging_live.html shows the badge
when plugged + completed + not actively charging.

NOTE: the exact on-car semantics of 3736 (does it read 1 at full charge?) must be confirmed on a
real charge — the car was asleep when this was built, so here we exercise the PLUMBING with
synthetic values. CI-safe (tmp DB, no network)."""
