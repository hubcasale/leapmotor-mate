"""#222 @ghuaywen-ai — the charger's own kWh, and the care a typed-in number is owed.

Mate reads what went INTO the battery. A public charger bills what came OUT of its own meter, and
the difference is real money. So the owner can type that figure in — and from there on it prices the
charge exactly as a wallbox counter does at home, while the energy Mate reports stays measured.

The whole point of these tests is the *care*, not the arithmetic:

  · it is not on screen until it is opened on purpose — a number that silently prices a charge must
    not be reachable by a stray click, or by a Tab landing in it while scrolling a day of charges;
  · it never comes pre-filled — not with the previous value, not with the measured energy — so an
    accidental open followed by Enter changes nothing;
  · there is one way in. It used to ride on the charge-TYPE form, where re-tagging a charge and
    typing this number were the same request.

Rendered, not read: the version of this file that only grepped the template would have passed with
the field wide open.
