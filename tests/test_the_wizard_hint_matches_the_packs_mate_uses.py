"""The wizard's manual-entry hint must quote the packs Mate actually uses, in every language.

The field it sits under decides every kWh, €/kWh and consumption figure that install will ever
print, and it wants the **usable (net)** capacity — the number `battery_packs.EU_BATTERY_MAP`
offers when the model is recognised. The hint under it listed something else:

  * `B10 Pro: 56.2 · B10 Pro Max: 67.1 · T03: 37.3` are the **gross** nameplate figures, while
    `C10 RWD: 67.0 · C10 AWD: 81.9` on the same line are net — two units, one list;
  * two of the eight languages still read `C10 RWD: 69,9`, the value #246 disproved and v3.11.2
    replaced;
  * `B05` was missing from all eight, although the wizard offers it a pack;
  * the input was pre-filled with **67.1** — the gross B10 Pro Max — so anyone whose car was not
    recognised, which is the ONLY way to reach this field, was one click away from committing a
    stranger's battery. On a T03 that is an 86% error, applied in silence.

This file is the reason it cannot drift again: every number in the hint has to exist in the map.
It deliberately does NOT import web.main (fastapi is absent in the minimal CI env, and
`test_reev_variant_setup.py` skips itself there, leaving the pack figures unprotected) — the map
lives in its own module for exactly that reason.
