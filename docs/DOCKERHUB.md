# LeapMotor Mate

**Trip tracking, charge logging and remote control for Leapmotor vehicles** — a self-hosted
companion (think *TeslaMate* for Leapmotor). Runs as a **standalone Docker container** or as a
**Home Assistant add-on**.

Supported models: **B10 · C10 · T03** (European spec).

![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/main/docs/screenshots/overview.png)

## Features

- 🚗 **Trips** — automatic logging with GPS track, distance, energy, efficiency and regen
- 🔌 **Charges** — sessions with energy, cost (flat or time-of-use bands), wallbox integration
- 🔋 **Battery health** — SoH estimate from real DC energy, with temperature-aware filtering
- 🎛️ **Remote control** — climate, locks, windows, seat heating, charge limit, schedules, one-touch "prepare car"
- 🏠 **Home Assistant / MQTT** — full MQTT Discovery: sensors, switches and controls appear automatically
- 🗺️ **Live map**, statistics, vampire-drain insight, ABRP and EVCC integration
- 🌍 English · Italiano · Français · Deutsch — metric & imperial units
- 🔒 **Self-hosted & private** — your data stays in a local SQLite database, no third-party cloud

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -d --name leapmotor-mate \
